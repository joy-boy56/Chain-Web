# Chain-Web
A Website based game based on chain reaction. 

This is a web page game based on a game named Chain reaction, But the original game lacks support for newer devices.
So this game is built for entertainment and not for profitable gains. Fair use of AI has been used for creating this.
(I used claude. It is too good btw).
