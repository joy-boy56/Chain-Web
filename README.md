# Chain-Web 🎮

A browser-based strategic grid game inspired by classic chain-reaction style mechanics.  
Built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This is a web page game based on a game named Chain reaction, But the original game lacks support for newer devices.
So this game is built for entertainment and not for profitable gains. Fair use of AI has been used for creating this.
(I used claude. It is too good btw).

# Play the game.(locally)

# Online version - Github pages

# Disclaimer 
This project is an independent recreation inspired by the game mechanics of Chain Reaction. No affiliation with the original developers.

## 🚀 About the Project

Chain Web is a turn-based strategy game where players place orbs in a grid.  
When a cell reaches its critical mass, it explodes and spreads to adjacent cells — potentially triggering cascading reactions.

The objective is simple:
> Eliminate your opponent by taking control of all cells on the board.

This project was developed to:
- Recreate a classic gameplay mechanic for modern browsers
- Improve responsiveness compared to older mobile versions
- Practice DOM manipulation and state management in JavaScript
- Build a complete deployable web project

## 🧠 Gameplay Rules

- Players take turns placing orbs in empty or owned cells.
- Each cell has a maximum capacity depending on its position:
  - Corner cells: 2
  - Edge cells: 3
  - Middle cells: 4
- When the limit is reached:
  - The cell explodes
  - Orbs are distributed to adjacent cells
  - Ownership may change
- Chain reactions can occur.
- The player who eliminates all opponent cells wins.
